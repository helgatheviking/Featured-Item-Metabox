Quickly add a metabox to any post type for marking a post as featured.  Toggle featured status even more quickly from the posts lists/ quick edit screen.

== Description ==

I found I constantly needed a way for clients to mark a post as something they wanted to feature and I've never found sticky posts particularly inuitive and the UI is pretty hidden for new users.  The simplest solution was a checkbox in prominently located metabox.

Please note that this plugin, by itself, will not change how your posts are displayed.  It just gives the UI to users and a meta key to theme developers to query for.

= Usage =

This plugin simply adds a `_featured` meta key to every post with a value of `yes` for featured items and `no` for everything else.  Actual display of the featured items is entirely up to the theme developer, but an example ( place in your template where you'd like to display a list of featured "Portfolios") might be as follows:

`
// params for our query
$args = array(
	'post_type' => 'portfolio',
   'posts_per_page'  => 5,
   'meta_key'        => '_featured',
   'meta_value'      => 'yes'
);

// The Query
$featured_portfolios = new WP_Query( $args );

// The Loop
if ( $featured_portfolios ) :

	echo '<ul class="featured">';

	while ( $featured_portfolios->have_posts() ) :
		$featured_portfolios->the_post();
		echo '<li>' . get_the_title() . '</li>';
	endwhile;

	echo '</ul>';

else :

	echo 'No featured portfolios found.';

endif;

/* Restore original Post Data
 * NB: Because we are using new WP_Query we aren't stomping on the
 * original $wp_query and it does not need to be reset.
*/
wp_reset_postdata();
`

Multiple queries per page load can slow down your site so it is worthwhile to take advantage of the [Transients API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API), so an alternate usage would be:

`
// Get any existing copy of our transient data
if ( false === ( $featured_portfolios = get_transient( 'featured_portfolios' ) ) ) {
    // It wasn't there, so regenerate the data and save the transient

   // params for our query
	$args = array(
		'post_type' => 'portfolio',
	   'posts_per_page'  => 5,
	   'meta_key'        => '_featured',
	   'meta_value'      => 'yes'
	);

	// The Query
	$featured_portfolios = new WP_Query( $args );

	// store the transient
	set_transient( 'featured_portfolios', $featured_portfolios );

}

// Use the data like you would have normally...

// The Loop
if ( $featured_portfolios ) :

	echo '<ul class="featured">';

	while ( $featured_portfolios->have_posts() ) :
		$featured_portfolios->the_post();
		echo '<li>' . get_the_title() . '</li>';
	endwhile;

	echo '</ul>';

else :

	echo 'No featured portfolios found.';

endif;

/* Restore original Post Data
 * NB: Because we are using new WP_Query we aren't stomping on the
 * original $wp_query and it does not need to be reset.
*/
wp_reset_postdata();
`

Then to ensure that your featured posts list is updated, add a function to your theme's functions.php to delete the transient when a portfolio (in this example) post type is saved.

`
// Create a function to delete our transient when a portfolio post is saved
function save_post_delete_featured_transient( $post_id ) {
   if ( 'portfolio' == get_post_type( $post_id ) )
   	delete_transient( 'featured_portfolios' );
}
// Add the function to the save_post hook so it runs when posts are saved
add_action( 'save_post', 'save_post_delete_featured_transient' );
`

Simple queries should only need the `meta_key` and `meta_value` parameters, but if you need something more advanced then you might want to read about how to use the more [complex Meta Query parameters](http://scribu.net/wordpress/advanced-metadata-queries.html).
